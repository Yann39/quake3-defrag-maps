## General

Some **Quake 3 arena** maps I created a long time ago (early 2004) for the **DeFRag** mod.

Build with **GTK Radiant 1.5.0** for **DeFRag 1.9**.

Of course there are much more better tools and resources now to build awesome maps, they are not optimized, but these are the original ones! :)
